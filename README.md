TechnoPeace is a monorepo for turning environmental and celestial data into playable soundscapes and visual rings. It includes a Vite/React web app, a FastAPI backend for rendering audio from weather and astronomy signals, and worker jobs that automate daily ingest + render pipelines.  The goal: play the world.
